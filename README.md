A Vita Port of [Lolicopocalypse, a game by quasist for Ludum Dare 24](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=14722).

[dots-tb](https://github.com/dots-tb) did most of the work including finding the game, getting it to compile, controls and handling sound. I only did the image scaling and the live area.
